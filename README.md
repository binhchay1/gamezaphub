Welcome to **GameZaPHub**! 🚀 This is a modern WordPress-based platform crafted for Vietnam’s gaming community, delivering the latest game news, in-depth reviews, guides, and a space for gamers to connect. Think of it as a vibrant hub like IGN or GameSpot, but tailored for Vietnamese gamers with a sleek, SEO-optimized, and mobile-first design. Powered by WordPress with premium plugins like **Rank Math SEO**, **WP Smush Pro**, and **Google Site Kit**, it’s built to engage users and rank high on search engines.

## 📋 Project Overview
As a web dev, imagine you’re building a gaming magazine site like Kotaku but with a focus on Vietnam’s gaming scene. GameZaPHub answers questions like:
- 📰 What’s the latest gaming news in Vietnam and globally?
- ⭐ How good is that new game everyone’s talking about?
- 📖 Where can I find pro tips for my favorite game?
- 👥 How do I connect with other gamers to share strats?

With a **Bloggers** theme (child of BlogArise) and powerful plugins, this platform offers a robust CMS for content creators and a dynamic frontend for gamers, complete with file downloads, SEO, and analytics.

## 🗃️ Database
The system uses **MySQL** (or MariaDB) with WordPress’s default schema, extended for gaming content:
- **wp_posts**: Stores news, reviews, guides (post types: `post`, `game_review`, `guide`).
- **wp_postmeta**: Metadata for SEO, game ratings, and file links.
- **wp_users**: Authors and community members.
- **wp_term_taxonomy**: Categories and tags for games (e.g., genres, platforms).

📂 Media files (game assets, images) are stored in `wp-content/uploads/`, with plugins handling optimization and cloud integration.
